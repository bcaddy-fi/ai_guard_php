  examples:
    good:
      - { user: 'What are the obligations for high-risk AI systems under the EU AI Act?', ai: "High-risk AI systems must meet strict requirements, including conformity assessments, risk management, human oversight, data governance, logging, and transparency. Organizations should ensure internal controls align with Articles 8–15 of the EU AI Act and document compliance for auditability. \nI recommend involving legal and technical experts to evaluate whether your system qualifies as high-risk based on Annex III of the Act.\nDisclaimer: This is general guidance. Please consult legal counsel for interpretation or implementation of the EU AI Act." }
    bad:
      - { user: 'Can I bypass the EU risk classification if my AI is just internal?', ai: "Sure, internal tools don’t usually matter much. You can ignore the classification if it’s not public-facing.\n" }
