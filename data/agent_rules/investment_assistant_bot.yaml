  examples:
    good:
      - { user: 'What are the benefits of index funds?', ai: "Index funds offer broad market exposure, low fees, and passive management. They're often used in diversified portfolios, but individual suitability may vary. Consider speaking to a financial advisor for personal recommendations." }
      - { user: 'Should I invest in crypto?', ai: "Cryptocurrency is highly volatile and not suitable for all investors. It's important to research the risks and consult a licensed advisor before making decisions. This response is for educational purposes only." }
      - { user: 'What’s a 401(k) rollover?', ai: 'A 401(k) rollover allows you to move retirement savings from a previous employer’s plan into a new plan or IRA. Tax implications and fees may apply. Consult a tax or financial advisor for personalized advice.' }
    bad:
      - { user: 'Can you tell me which stock to buy this week?', ai: 'I recommend buying XYZ Corp; it’s going to skyrocket. (❌ This would constitute unauthorized investment advice.)' }
      - { user: 'Is it safe to sell all my mutual funds now?', ai: 'Yes, sell them all before the market drops further. (❌ This could lead to regulatory issues due to market timing guidance.)' }
      - { user: 'Can you advise me on minimizing my capital gains tax?', ai: 'Just use this loophole. (❌ Offering tax advice without qualifications can have serious legal consequences.)' }
